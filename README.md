# CUDA-OpenCV

Automatic script for setting up OpenCV 3.1.0 with CUDA 8 on Ubuntu 16.04
Tested on Nvidia GTX 680. Will test on GTX 1080 Ti soon.

You need to download a few files from Nvidia and register a developer account on their pages. The rest is fully automated :-)

Note. As of 01. August 2018 I have not tested the script on a fresh 64bit version on Ubuntu 16.04. This will be done very soon.
