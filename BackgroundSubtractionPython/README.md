Python implementation of backgroundsubtraction

Just a placeholder for now!

For accelerated reading of the video file maybee this will work :
 * https://github.com/mitmul/pynvvl

Briefly tested on
 * OpenCV 3.4.1 with CUDA 8
 * OpenCV 3.1.0 with CUDA 8   (3.1.0 patched to build with CUDA 8)
 
Following Python versions where used during the test:
* Python 2.7.12
* Python 3.5.2

Sample output is provided. 240x240pixel frames for processing in Tensorflow later.
